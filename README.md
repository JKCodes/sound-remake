# SoundRedux

Note: This is not my own project.  I'm doing this to further my knowledge in React/Redux and to see if I can code this from scratch from only looking at the code.  I'm excited to see what I can learn from this experience, and I plan on using what I learn from this project on my future projects.

Visit [Sound-Redux](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux) for the actual project.
